							<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
							<p>	Hey there! I'm a 22-year-old living in Vietnam, deeply passionate about digital stuff. Whether it's diving into design, coding, or creating content, I find immense joy in exploring different ways to express ideas and bring them to life online. As a bit of an introvert, I sometimes find comfort in the digital world, where I can let my creativity soar. When I'm not tinkering with digital projects, you can often find me immersed in music, movies, videos, or diving into the world of gaming. I'm always up for a challenge and love collaborating with others to make things happen in the digital realm.

								Though, I must admit, I'm really bad at playing sports and some social skills. But hey, nobody's perfect, right? Despite these shortcomings, I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for creating amazing things in the digital realm. So, if you're into crafting cool stuff online and don't mind a bit of social awkwardness, let's connect and see what awesome projects we can bring to life together!</p>

							<h2>MY RESUME</h2>
							<p>	Since 2022, I've had the pleasure of working with a small but dynamic tissue company called CALLA for about a year and a half. Despite its size, CALLA has always had big ambitions, and in 2023, they made a bold move by venturing into a new market segment. This led to the creation of VANILA, a sister company specializing in food cleaning salt products. Being part of a small company meant that I wore many hats, and I was thrilled to be heavily involved in the inception of VANILA.
								
								From brainstorming sessions to product development meetings, I contributed my skills and expertise to help shape VANILA's identity and product line. It was an exhilarating experience to be part of a team that was building something from the ground up. Alongside my involvement in product creation, I also took on the responsibility of spearheading marketing campaigns for both CALLA and VANILA.
								
								Despite the limited resources and budget constraints of a small company, I embraced the challenge of creating impactful campaigns that would resonate with our target audience. From crafting compelling messaging to designing eye-catching visuals, I poured my heart and soul into each campaign, striving to effectively communicate the unique value propositions of our products.
								
								Working in a small company environment provided me with invaluable opportunities to take on diverse roles and responsibilities. It taught me the importance of adaptability, creativity, and resourcefulness in overcoming challenges and driving success. Being part of the growth journey of both CALLA and VANILA was not only professionally rewarding but also personally fulfilling.
								
								Looking back, I'm proud of the contributions I made to help elevate both companies and position them for future growth and success. The experience has reinforced my passion for entrepreneurship and my desire to continue making a meaningful impact in the business world. And if you think my resume too short, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT, IM STILL A STUDENT!!!</p>

							<h2>MY PROJECT</h2>
							<p>Throughout my journey, I've tried out lots of different projects, each showing my curiosity and wanting to make things happen. Some might seem small or not so important, but they all mean something to me and help me learn new stuff.

								Whether it's a fun little project exploring new design styles or a coding test to fix everyday problems, each one teaches me something valuable. These projects aren't just about learning technical stuff, they're also about being determined and able to handle whatever comes up.
								
								Even though they're all different, each project is a part of my journey and shows how much I love exploring the online world. I'm always ready for new projects, no matter how big or small, and excited to see where they take me next.  </p>
